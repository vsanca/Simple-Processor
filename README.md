# Simple-Processor

## Simple processor and assembler | VHDL + C | E2LP development board

This project is a result of experimenting with the E2LP board (http://www.e2lp.org/) and with knowledge gained in courses of Logical Projecting of Computing Systems.

The result is a simple processor with small instruction set written in VHDL meant to be run on E2LP board. Sources can be found in the *Processor* folder.

In order to run programs written in human syntax, a simple Assembler language has been conceived and written in C. After running the assembler on the program source input,
machine code is generated in form of 2 .vhd files needed to be placed in the Processor folder.

This is a simple concept and project used for research of logical components and processor architecture, as well as looking into more theoretical aspects of machine code, computer architecture and a good introduction to compilers.
